    <h3>Driven Pendulum, Resonance</h3>
    <p> Pushing a a swing in tune with its natural resonant frequency will make
      it go higher, ie. maximum amplitude. A pendulum is made using a permanent
      magnet suspended on a peice of paper and the pusing is done by a coil
      powered from SQR1. One end of a folded paper is held between two button
      magnets. The distance from the center of the magnet to the point of
      suspension is taken as its length. </p>
