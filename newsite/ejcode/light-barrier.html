    <h3>Light-Barrier</h3>
    <p> A photo-transistor plus LED combination can be used for measuring light
      transmission and for sensing the timing of mechanical movements. The LED
      is powered by SQR1. The collector of the photo-transistor is connected to
      SEN, which is connected to 5 volts through a 5.1k resistor. The voltage at
      the collector of the photo transistor changes according to the amount of
      light falling on it. The built-in analog comparator on SEN input is used
      for timing measurements when the light crosses a certain threshold. </p>
