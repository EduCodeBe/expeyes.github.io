    <h3>Interference of Sound</h3>
    <p>Two different frequencies are generated on SQR1 and SQR2 and both are
      connected to passive Piezo buzzers. The sound is captured by the built-in
      microphone and connected to A1 after amplification. The two sinusoids are
      added up to give an envelope. The frequency difference between the two
      sources in the beat frequency. </p>
