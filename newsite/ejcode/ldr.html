    <h3>Light Dependent Resistor, LDR</h3>
    <p> Resistance of the LDR is measured by comparing it with a 10k resistor.
      PVS is set to 4 volts and the LDR and 10k resistor are connected from PVS
      to GND in series. The voltage across 10k is measured to find out the
      current. The voltage drop across the LDR is obtained by subtracting IN1
      from PVS. Using these and the value of current, the resistance of LDR is
      calculated. </p>
