    <h3>Velocity of Sound</h3>
    <p> Calculate the velocity of sound by measuring the pressure variation with
      distance. Sound travels as a series of compressions and rarefactions.
      Figure shows the High and Low pressure regions along the direction of
      travel, along with output of a pressure sensor at corresponding positions.
      We can display the pressure variation at any point with respect to the
      variation at the starting point. The phase of the microphone output
      waveform changes as you change its distance from the Piezo. Moving by one
      wavelength changes the phase by 360 degrees. If the phase changes by X
      degrees for D cm change in distance, the wavelength is given by λ = 360×
      D/X .</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The velocity of sound can be calculated by
      multiplying the frequency with this.
      The Piezo buzzer is driven by SQR1 and it is kept in front of the built-in
      microphone. The MIC output is connected to A1. The phase difference
      between the driving waveform and the MIC output is measured for different
      distances between the buzzer and the microphone.&nbsp;</p>
