    <h3>Transistor CE characteristic</h3>
    <p> Two variable voltages are required to measure the Common Emitter
      characteristic of a transistor, for the collector and the base. The PVS
      output is connected to the collector through a 1k resistor. A DC voltage
      is generated by operating the SQR1 in Pulse Width Modulated mode. The
      output is filtered using an RC circuit (R=200k, C=100uF) . This voltage is
      applied to the base of the transistor. PVS is varied and the collector
      voltage is plotted against the collector current for different base
      currents. Base current is calculated by (SQR1 out - 0.65)/200k . </p>
