    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the "Six Days Training
    Programs" conducted at IUAC twice a year, we also support "One Day
    Workshops" at other institutions by providing a resource person. The host
    institution should be able to arrange the participation of
    physics/electronics faculty from the colleges in that region. For more
    information contact bpajith at gmail dot com<br>
