    <h3>Transient response of RL circuit</h3>
    <p> The transient response of an RL circuit is studied by applying a step
      voltage and observing the voltage across the inductor as a function of
      time. Connect the resistor from OD1 to A1 and the Inductor from A1 to GND.
      In response to the 5-&gt;0 volt step, the voltage across inductor suddenly
      goes to around -3 volts (the back EMF) and then discharges exponentially
      through the resistor. The R/L is extracted by fitting the graph and the
      value of inductor is obtained. We have used a 1k resistor and a 3000 turns
      coil of SWG44 wire. </p>
