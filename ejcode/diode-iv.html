    <h3>Diode IV</h3>
    <p> Diode I-V characteristic is plotted using the setup shown below. A
      1N4148 silicon diode and a 1k resistor is connected in series from PVS to
      GND. The PVS output is varied from 0 to 5 volts and the voltage across the
      diode is measured in each case. The current is obtained from the voltage
      drop across the 1k resistor. The data is fitted with the diode equation to
      extract the ideality factor of the diode. </p>
