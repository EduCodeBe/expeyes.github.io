    <h3>Velocity of sound, using 40kHz piezo</h3>
    <p> The 40 kHz Piezo Transmitter is driven by SQR1. The Receiver output is
      connected to A1. The phase difference between the driving square wave and
      the sine wave received at A1 is measured as a function of distance between
      the transmitter and the receiver. </p>
