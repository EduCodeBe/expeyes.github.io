    <h3>Persistence of vision, flickering LED</h3>
    <p> Power an LED with using SQR1 and change its frequency gradually from 1Hz
      to 50Hz to observe at what frequency the flickering stops. It may depend
      on the observer and the intensity of light. I felt the flickering stopping
      at around 40 Hz, and my son says it still flickers at that frequency.
      Connection: SQR1 --LED-- GND. No need of series resistor since SQR1 comes
      out via a 100 Ohm resistor. </p>
    <p>The program listed below gives a slider to change the SQR1 frequency.</p>

      from Tkinter import *<br>
      import expeyes.eyesj<br>
      p=expeyes.eyesj.open()<br>
      <br>
      def set_freq(w):<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; state = int(Sqr1.get())<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fr = float(Sqr1.get())<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; res = p.set_sqrs(fr)<br>
      <br>
      w = Tk()<br>
      Sqr1 = Scale(w,command = set_freq, orient=HORIZONTAL, length=200,
      showvalue=True, from_ = 1, to=50, resolution=.1)<br>
      Sqr1.pack()<br>
      w.mainloop()</p>
