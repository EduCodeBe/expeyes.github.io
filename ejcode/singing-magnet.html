    <h3>Singing Magnet</h3>
    <p> The force experienced by a current carrying conducter placed in a
      magnetic field is demonstrated by placing a permanent magnet inside a
      solenoid and applying an AC signal to it. The magnet moves back and forth
      up to a frequency of around 2000 Hz and a humming sound is produced. The
      working principle is same as that of a loudspeaker, where the magnet is
      fixed and the coil moves along with the paper cone. </p>
