    <h3>Optical Transmission of signals</h3>
    <p> Demonstrate the conversion of electrical signals into light,
      transmission of the light signals, and converting them back to electrical
      signals. A square wave (black trace) is applied to the LED and the light
      is send to the photo-transistor. The output of the photo-transistor (red
      trace) is also shown. The frequency information of the original waveform
      is preserved but the photo-transistor OFF time is slower than ON time. </p>
