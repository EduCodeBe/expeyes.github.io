              <div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Control
                  lamps, switches, motors and read voltages using small Python
                  programs and a circuit board connected to the USB port.<br>
                  The board provides 32 terminals that are organized in to 4
                  groups, each having 8 terminals, namely A, B,C and D. <br>
                  The individual terminals are marked as PA0 -- PA7 for port A,
                  PB0 -- PB7 for port B etc.</span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br>
                </span>
                <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
                    The terminals you are learning to manipulate belong to
                    Atmega32 micro-controller, but we only consider them as a
                    set of Registers accessible from Python.</span> The
                  user&nbsp; is expected to know Python and the binary number
                  system.<br>
                  <span style="font-family: sans-serif;"></span></div>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">The simplest thing to start with is to
        control LEDs connected to any of the terminals. Connect an LED from PB0
        to Ground with 5k resistor in series, for current limiting. The LED
        should blink when you run the Python program <a href="code/blink.py">blink.py</a>.</p>
      <div style="text-align: left;">Let us examine the code line by line:<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">from kuttyPy import *</span><br>
        This line imports the kuttyPy module ( kuttyPy.py should be in your
        working directory). This module gives you&nbsp; functions that can
        read/write the Registers of the micro-controller connected to the USB
        port.&nbsp; This line also searches for the hardware on the available
        USB ports. If nothing found, ith program is terminated.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">setReg(DDRB,255)</span><br>
        DDRB is an 8bit Register that decides the direction of the terminals PB0
        -- PB7. If a bit is 1, the corresponding terminal becomes an output. If
        it is zero, the terminal becomes an input. DDR stands for Data Direction
        Register. The last letter represents the port, for example DDRA decides
        the direction of port A.<br>
        <br>
        time.sleep(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; , for a one second wait<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">setReg(PORTB,255)</span><br>
        PORTB is an 8bit Register where you set the output level of the
        terminals PB0 -- PB7. If a bit is 1, the voltage at the corresponding
        terminal becomes HIGH, else it becomes LOW. Here we are making all the
        terminals HIGH, means LED conected to any of them will glow.&nbsp; In a
        similar manner you can use PORTA, PORTC and PORTD.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">setReg(PORTB, 0)</span><br>
        As explained above, PB0 to PB7 will be set to LOW.<br>
        <br>
        Running this loop makes the LEDs connected to any of the terminals PB0
        to PB7 will blink. The frequency will be decide by the value given to
        time.sleep()<br>
